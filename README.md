## Graveler Opencl

see: https://github.com/arhourigan/graveler

implementation in opencl using the rust crate opencl3

same solution as before but now tries to split the work evenly across the gpu.

and uses thorios method of reading all the bits from the generated bytes (https://github.com/arhourigan/graveler/issues/4#issuecomment-2282775988)

using my geforce mx150 i get a benchmark time of 1.5s for 1b iterations

will possibly get faster results using a better gpu but im not sure.
this is my first time using opencl so i am not confident in my strategy of deviding work.

### UPDATE

running on a gtx 1080 ti gives about 200ms for 1b iterations
